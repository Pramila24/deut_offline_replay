The very preliminary online d(e,e'p) absolute cross sections have been calculated.

2D online histograms were binned in missing momentum (Pm) vs. recoil angle (thrq)
1D missing momentum histograms were projected along thrq (Y-projections) 

The plots are as follows:

Plot1: 2D online histograms
-------------------------
(a) raw (e,e'p) data counts without any corrections

(b) ratio of non-radiative to radiative SIMC yield
    to be used as radiative correction factor

(c) SIMC phase space (un-weighted) to be used in cross-section calculations
units: dE' * dOmega_e * dOmega_p * (luminosity/Ntried),
dE'     : e- energy (MeV)
dOmega_e: e- solid angle (sr)
dOmega_p: proton solid angle (sr)
luminosity: charge/targetfac,
Ntried: events thrown into detector volume

(d) data yield normalized to total charge and corrected for
total live time, hms/shms track inefficinecy, radiative effects

(e) data online cross sections determined by dividing (d) by (c)
(data yield / SIMC phase space),
units: ub sr^{-2} MeV^{-1}

(f) SIMC online cross sections determined by dividing non-radiative
SIMC yield by phase space


Plot2: Raw Missing Momentum Counts
------------------------------------
uncorrected missing momentum counts used to
calculate / monitor the statistical error during online
data taking (simply take 1/sqrt(N) for each bin content to
determine the relative error per missing momentum bin)


Plot3: Relative Statistical Error
----------------------------------
relative error per missing momentum bin
used to monitor statistics collected online
a +/- 15 % line is used as reference


Plot4: SIMC Non-Radiative to Radiative
----------------------------------------
ratio of non-radiative to radiative SIMC yields
using Jean-Marc Laget (JML) FSI model (NN Paris potential)


Plot5: DATA Rdiative Corrections
----------------------------------
data charge-normalized yields before and after applying the
non-radiative to radiative correction factor shown in Plot4.

Plot6: SIMC Phase Space
-------------------------
SIMC phase space (un-weighted) binned in recoil angles, thrq,
to be used in denominator of cross-sections calculations


Plot7: DATA Online Cross Sections
----------------------------------
Data online cross sections compared to JML PWIA, FSI models
and our previous Hall C d(e,e'p) cross-section measurements in 2018

Legend:
black: data d(e,e'p) 120 MeV/c central setting (online, 2023) 
blue: JML Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA)
green: JML Final-State Interactions (FSI)
red: d(e,e'p) 80 MeV/c central setting (2018)
