# shell script to automatically run CaFe SIMC analysis

# NOTE: During the online analysis, the user can do SIMC analysis of
# CaFe heep, MF or SRC kinematics, with assumed targets:
# hydrogen (heep) , carbon-12 (MF), deuterium (SRC), respectively.
# The SIMC raw data file is assumed to exist, and this script will
# ONLY analyze the file (i.e, weight it, apply exact cuts as data, and
# (in the near future), will be able to scale to other targets using target density ratio


#user input
