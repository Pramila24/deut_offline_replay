# shell script to automatically run CaFe data replay followed by data analysis

# NOTE: During the online analysis, the user can do a partial analysis while the run
# is still going, by simply specifying the number of events, provdided that number has
# been collected already by the DAQ. For example, the user might look at 100k event replay
# in order to make count estimates, and projections on how long the run will take.


# Which analysis file type are we doing? "prod" or "sample"
